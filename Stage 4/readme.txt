
EXECUTE JAR FILE
To run a JAR file, first make sure you have Java installed by running java -version in your terminal.
Then navigate to the folder containing the JAR and run it with java -jar filename.jar.
If it doesn’t run, the JAR may require a newer Java version than the one you have installed.
